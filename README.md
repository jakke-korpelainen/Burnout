# Burnout
A simple console application containing a simulation of a programmer chugging through amounts of work. Will attempt to progress this into a proper game some day. Application asks for user to input some of the parameters used in simulation.


**Terms/params explained:**

* *Workload* - basically how much work the simulation will create
* *Energy* - initial energy, affects effiency and is consumed and regained while working
* *Recovery Rate* - rate of energy regain, will get halved when burnout saves have been used
* *Burnout Saves* - this can be used to replenish the energy used in work
* *Burnout Trigger* - trigger when saves can be triggered if any are remaining
* *Burnout Counter* - this is used to calculate progress into the trigger above
